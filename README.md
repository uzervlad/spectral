**Spectral** is a utility for timing songs for use in rhythm games, using a spectrogram as a visual guide.

> [!WARNING]
> The project is in its early stages, expect breakage and very rough UX

### How to run

#### Prerequisites

* Rust (https://rust-lang.org/)

```bash
$ cargo run --release
```

<small>It is recommended to run in release mode, since spectrogram rendering is incredibly slow</small>
